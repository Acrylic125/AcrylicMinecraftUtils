<h3>What does this API offer?</h3>
<p> Bear in mind the features offered avoids the use of NMS (net.minecraft.server) due to complexities I do not want to deal with in the making of this. I will however use NMS for my other projects. Also, these features are designed to have full 1.8 and the latest version of minecraft support. Therefore, there are 2 seperate submodules called <b>Version_LATEST</b> and <b>Version_1_8</b>.
<ul>
  <li>Animations (Armor Stand and Giant Support ✔ </li>
  <li>ChatUtils (Inclusive of JSON support) 50% </li>
  <li>GUI ✔ </li>
  <li>Items 80% </li>
  <li>Probability ✔ </li>
  <li>EnchantAPI ✔ </li>
  <li>Regions 20% </li>
  <li>Cooldowns System ?% </li>
  <li>Pathfinding 0% (Recode) </li>
  <li>JSON and YML Support 0% </li>
  <li>MongoDB and Morphia Support 0% </li>
  <li>Shapes 60% </li>
  <li>Scoreboard and Teams 0% </li>
  <li>Serializers and Parsers 0%</li>
  <li>Utils
    <ul>
      <li>Teleport Utils ✔</li>
      <li>Time Converter 0%</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>ADD MAVEN SUPPORT!</b></li>

<br>
More features will be added as the project grows. For now, the main features must be completed before I proceed on to the projects I will be using this for.
